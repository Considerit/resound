# I have two audio tracks. One track is a song. The other track is a reaction â€” a recording of 
# one or two people reacting to the song. The reaction track contains a possibly distorted, though 
# fairly nicely aligned, playback of the song, as well as reactor(s) commenting occassionally on top 
# of the song. Because the reactors are re-encoding the audio (including the sound), as well 
# as having a lot of variation, there are pitch, volume, and other differences in the reaction 
# audioâ€™s version of the song. 

# The only thing I really care about in the reaction audio are the sounds the reactor makes while the 
# base song is playing. This is the backchannel -- the sounds that a listener makes without taking the 
# speaking baton (laughs, signs, shouts, brief comments, etc).

# Because I'm compiling these reaction tracks together, I have a way to isolate the backchannel sounds 
# in the reaction audio from the audio of the song itself in the reaction audio. Subtracting out the 
# base audio from the aligned reaction didn't work, but then I realized I could simply try to detect 
# the portions of the reaction audio where the reactor was making noise, without trying to eliminate 
# the base song audio. Reactors don't make noise that often relative to the length of the song, so 
# I could just mute all the segments of the reaction audio where we didn't detect an active backchannel. 
# Then when we stitch all the reaction together, only a few reactors will tend to be active at the 
# same time. This has proven tractible. 

# I invented a new measure to help find active backchannels: Relative Volume Difference. Consider an audio track. 
# Calculate the max perceptual volume in the track. For each audio sample in the track calculate the percentage 
# of the max observed volume, and store it in a vector. Now we have a normalized measure to compare against other 
# tracks! If we compare the percentile volume vectors for the base audio track and an aligned reaction track 
# where the reactor doesn't make any noise, the vectors should be about the same. If we subtract one from the 
# other, the resulting vector should be close to zero throughout. However, because volume is a measure of energy, 
# a reactor adds energy to the audio signal whenever they make noise. The insight is thus that the backchannel 
# is active when the percentile volume of the reaction audio is significantly higher than the percentile 
# volume of the base song audio. So we can find the backchannel by subtracting the percentile volume vector of 
# the song audio from the percentile volume vector of the reaction audio, and declaring the back channel 
# active when the value is above some threshold (with some smoothing as well of course).

# This all works fairly well, but there are still significant false positives and negatives. 
# I'd like to improve on these issues. Before we delve into those issues though, I'd like to ask you about
# you:
# (1) What do you think of this approach? What would you change or add? 
# (2) How would you approach the issue of backchannel isolation given a reaction track and song track? 
# (3) Has relative volume difference already been invented, and if so, by what name does it go by? 
# (4) Are there other metrics that could also leverage the relationship between the reaction and 
#     song track, and serve as confirming metrics? 



# In particular, I'd like to 
# address false positives in the identification of a meaningful backchannel activation.
